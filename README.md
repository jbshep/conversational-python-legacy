Conversational Python is an introduction to computer science in Python using a
format that is more like a conversational tutorial than a textbook.

This is the 1st edition of the textbook.  It was created using softcover.io and
Markdown.  The book has since been migrated to Sphinx and reStructuredText. The
new repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jbshep/conversational-python/).
